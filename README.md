# 2-ControlFlow
First steps into logic and control flow.  Learn and practice basic if / else statements, switch statements, and brush up on logical operators.  Learning syntax is one thing, but thinking differently, thinking with logic is a skill that has to be practiced. This is critical. Practice what is in this repo and read up on control flow.  While this scratches the surface, google and read up on logical operators in C#.

## Git
Clone this repo and continue with what's in this program.cs  If you are still unsure of how to clone repositories, I highly recommend you google it and practice doing that.
